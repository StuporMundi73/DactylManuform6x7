## Introduction <a name="intro"/>[]()

Not long ago I fell into the rabbit hole of... let's call it "keyboard optimization". For a while I have been very fond of the [Kinesis Advantage 2](https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2/), but over time I grew more and more unhappy with the tiny F-keys and the Cherry Brown switches that I chose (for details see [But... Why???](#why)). So I started looking for alternatives and after a while warmed up to the idea of building my own [Dactyl Manuform](https://github.com/abstracthat/dactyl-manuform).

Having no actual soldering skill I initially balked at the idea of  doing SMD soldering (not strictly necessary for a Dactyl Manuform build, but definitely needed if you want per-key-RGB). But ready-built Dactyls are kind of pricey - and often do not have all the bells and whistles. Plus: After all it's fun to try something new every once in a while... And so here we are.

When I started I had to gather what I know now from various sources. Inevitably, at times I would have hoped to have a bit more detail here, a bit more guidance there - so I ended up writing this guide, adding one more to the plethora of guides on building a Dactyl Manuform - hoping that the next lunatic building his first keyboard may benefit from mine the same way I benefited from the things that I have found on that journey.


## Step 1: Choosing what will be needed <a name="choices"/>[]()

General note: I am not affiliated to any of the shops or brands mentioned here, nor am I getting paid or otherwise compensated for mentioning them.

### The Case

Opting for a Dactyl Manuform is just the beginning of a series of decisions you'll have to take when starting to work on your keyboard. 3D-printing afficionados usually head to [_abstracthat_'s repository](https://github.com/abstracthat/dactyl-manuform) - which by the way also has some very instructive diagrams on wiring the key matrices! - download the software to build the model they want and then let their 3D printer do its job.

I do not own such a device, nor did I plan to buy one for this project - but that's not really a problem as many of the aforementioned 3D-printing-afficionados offer their services for a reasonable fee. A short search with your search engine of choice will yield numerous results. The trading platform [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com) is also a good staring point.

I ended up buying from [Wylderbuilds](https://wylderbuilds.com), lured in by the nice-looking resin-printed housings they offer. The proprietor, Andy, was very helpful, patiently answering a bunch of noob questions. There are quite a few options at hand when ordering your case from Wylderbuilds:
* Resin vs. PLA printing (I went for resin; much more fine grained surface structure, but not quite perfect yet... we'll get back to this in [Step 2: Make the Cases Smooooooooooth](#smooth)).
* Color of the case (in my case: Smokey black translucent)
* Color of the case's bottom (translucent white - and I am still not sure whether I should have gotten plain black instead...)
* Layout (6x7 because I do not care much for these minimalistic tiny keyboards - I want the full set of keys to work with)
* Shape of the thumb clusters (6-key because it comes closest to what I am used to from working with the Advantage 2 board; note that there is also a kind-of-cool trackball option available instead)
* Switch mount options. Here you have a choice of "fixed" switches (switches held in place by the case, wires and diodes are soldered to the switches so you will probably not replace them any more), hot-swap with small cut-outs for the Kailh sockets built into the cases or hot-swap based on per-key PCBs like the Amoeba King. I went for the latter: The Amoebas make for a very clean build and give you the option of easily adding a per-key-RGB LED.

Soon after the order the following two beauties arrived via mail, still smelling a bit from the curing process:

## Retrospective

So, am I happy with my build? A definitive yes here. Are there things I would change if I had the chance? Also a definitive yes on that. It's kind of inevitable that you get new insights along the way that you could not incorporate any more. So what would I change?
1. Add a bay for a small display.<br>
Admittedly these mini display are not really making that much of a difference, especially if you have so many keys that you won't need complex layers to address all keystrokes. But they are kind of cool and fairly easy to attach, making the whole keyboard yet a little bit more perfect.
2. Add a fixed holder for a palm rest.<br>
Initially I thought it would be ok to just a pair of those gel pads and put them in front of the keyboard, but that leaves you with two separate parts that shift and wobble around as you type which can become quite irritating. The lack of firmly attached palm rests realy made me miss the Advantage 2 with the big flat surface in fron of the key wells which provides a good space to rest your palms on. There is an interesting build that brings back the geometry of the Advantage 2 as a split keyboard, the [Ergo S-1 keyboard](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1187300994/ergo-s-1-keyboard-case?click_key=e587a20d244e3471dc4917313bee7e81fb3507f2%3A1187300994&click_sum=bce6ddb5&ref=hp_rv-3). Alas, this doesn't have any F-keys and the thumb clusters have the classic Dactyl/Advantage 2 shape which in my eyes is inferior to the Dactyl Manuform's arrangement. Nothing is perfect...
